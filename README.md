# ImageSort
ImageSort is an rather old program I use regularly to sort thousands of images.

![How it works](How-It-Works.png?raw=true)

You simply choose a directory that contains *all* images you want to sort. 

Then you select a target directory where selected images will be copied to.

Now you start looking at every image and copying those that are good.

### Keyboard shortcuts
There are keyboard shortcuts to make the task easier.

* Space: **Rotate** current image by 90 degrees
* Enter: **Copy/Save** the current image
* Right arrow key: Move to the **next** image
* Left arrow key: Move to the **previous** image

That's all you need to know. If you want to see an image in another program, just double-click it.
You can also right-click the image to open it in file explorer. 

Another option is jumping to the any image by right-clicking, choosing "Jump to" and then typing in the number you want to visit.

### Languages
This program automatically runs in German or English. Other languages are currently not supported or planned.

### Use cases
If you ever had to go through hundreds or thousands of photos to get a few good ones, you will know how long it usually takes. Then you have to wait until the images are copied to your destination directory, then open the next one etc. That's annoying.

So the next time you want to create a photo book/album, just try this program.

### Limitations
This program is quite limited as it is thought to be used for this one use case.

* currently only considers files that have these extensions: JPG, JPEG, PNG and BMP

### Contributions
Contributions, suggestions, questions and any issue reports are very welcome. Please don't hesistate to ask :)

I probably won't add any large features though.
